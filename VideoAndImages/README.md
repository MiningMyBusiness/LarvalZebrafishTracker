# Video and image files
This folder contains the animated gif and image files that are on the front page of this project. These were created with Matlab. Animated gifs were used instead of videos since github does not allow video embedding in their markdown pages.

I have also posted the code used to make the animated gifs. This code can be easily modified to make animated gifs for any kind of video but it is has some specific parts that have to do with fish tracking.
